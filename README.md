# Road-Accident-Analysis
I have created a Power BI report on road accident analysis with the following steps:

I gathered the requirements for the dashboard for the analysis of traffic accidents, including the crucial metrics and visualisations.
Participants in the project: I selected the participants who will use the Power BI report, including traffic officers, road safety officers, and city planners.
Overview of raw data sources: I looked over the raw data sources, which would have included traffic department datasets, accident reports, meteorological information, and road surface conditions.

Data linking and loading into Power BI: For analysis, I connected to the appropriate datasets from the raw data sources.

Data transformation and cleaning with Power Query Editor: I utilised Power Query Editor to handle any missing numbers, formatting errors, or inconsistent data.

Data modelling: Using Power BI, I built a data model that outlined the connections between various tables and, where necessary, established hierarchies. 
This process enables effective data navigation and analysis.

PowerPoint backdrop design: To ensure an aesthetically pleasing and unified design, I used PowerPoint to create the background layout and theme for the Power BI report.

Building reports and dashboards: To properly present the analysed data, I made a number of reports and dashboards in Power BI. These reports include a variety of visuals, such as graphs, tables, and maps.

Data visualization/charts: I made instructive charts and graphs using Power BI's visualisation features. For instance, I made clustered column charts to compare casualties by types of roads, line charts to compare the monthly trend of casualties for the current year (CY) and the previous year (PY), donut charts to display CY casualties by urban/rural and dark/light conditions, and map charts to show casualties by location.

Insights: I gleaned insights from the data on traffic accidents using data analysis and visualisation. 
To increase road safety, these insights can assist stakeholders in understanding patterns, identifying high-risk regions, and making wise decisions.

The outcomes that can be derived from your Power BI report on road accident analysis are as follows:

Identification of high-risk areas: By analyzing the data on accident locations, stakeholders such as traffic officers and road safety officers can identify areas with a high frequency of accidents. This information can be used to prioritize resources for targeted interventions and safety improvements in those locations.

Understanding accident patterns: The insights gained from the data analysis and visualizations can help stakeholders understand the patterns and trends in road accidents. For example, they can identify the types of roads or road conditions that are associated with higher casualties and accidents. This knowledge can guide road design, maintenance, and enforcement strategies to enhance safety.

Evaluation of road safety measures: By comparing the current year's data with the previous year's data, stakeholders can assess the effectiveness of road safety measures that have been implemented. For instance, they can evaluate if certain initiatives or interventions have led to a reduction in accidents or casualties.

Impact of weather conditions: The analysis of accidents in relation to meteorological information and road surface conditions can provide insights into the impact of weather on road safety. Stakeholders can identify weather conditions that are frequently associated with accidents and take appropriate measures to address the risks, such as improving road maintenance during adverse weather or issuing weather-specific road safety advisories.

Decision-making for road planning and infrastructure: The data and visualizations can assist city planners and infrastructure developers in making informed decisions for road planning and design. For example, they can identify areas with a high concentration of accidents and prioritize infrastructure improvements, such as traffic calming measures or better signage, to enhance safety in those locations.

Monitoring progress and setting targets: By establishing metrics and tracking key indicators such as total casualties, accidents, and fatalities, stakeholders can monitor the progress of road safety initiatives over time. These metrics can also be used to set targets and goals for reducing accidents and improving road safety.

Overall, the outcomes from your Power BI report can help stakeholders gain a deeper understanding of road accidents, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance road safety and reduce the number of accidents and casualties.
Examples of insights include comprehending the distribution of casualties by vehicle type, identifying places with a high frequency of accidents, and determining the meteorological conditions most frequently related with accidents.
In order to assist time-based analysis, I also constructed a date calendar table and metrics like total CY casualties, total PY casualties, and total PY accidents, fatal, serious, and slight. 
Additionally, I developed a slicer to filter data according on the state of the weather and the road. I made a group depending on the kind of vehicle and the weather, and I computed measures for year-over-year (YOY) accidents and fatalities.
