# Road-Accident-Analysis
I have created a Power BI report on road accident analysis with the following steps:

I gathered the requirements for the dashboard for the analysis of traffic accidents, including the crucial metrics and visualisations.
Participants in the project: I selected the participants who will use the Power BI report, including traffic officers, road safety officers, and city planners.
Overview of raw data sources: I looked over the raw data sources, which would have included traffic department datasets, accident reports, meteorological information, and road surface conditions.

Data linking and loading into Power BI: For analysis, I connected to the appropriate datasets from the raw data sources.

Data transformation and cleaning with Power Query Editor: I utilised Power Query Editor to handle any missing numbers, formatting errors, or inconsistent data.

Data modelling: Using Power BI, I built a data model that outlined the connections between various tables and, where necessary, established hierarchies. 
This process enables effective data navigation and analysis.

PowerPoint backdrop design: To ensure an aesthetically pleasing and unified design, I used PowerPoint to create the background layout and theme for the Power BI report.

Building reports and dashboards: To properly present the analysed data, I made a number of reports and dashboards in Power BI. These reports include a variety of visuals, such as graphs, tables, and maps.

Data visualization/charts: I made instructive charts and graphs using Power BI's visualisation features. For instance, I made clustered column charts to compare casualties by types of roads, line charts to compare the monthly trend of casualties for the current year (CY) and the previous year (PY), donut charts to display CY casualties by urban/rural and dark/light conditions, and map charts to show casualties by location.

Insights: I gleaned insights from the data on traffic accidents using data analysis and visualisation. 
To increase road safety, these insights can assist stakeholders in understanding patterns, identifying high-risk regions, and making wise decisions.
Examples of insights include comprehending the distribution of casualties by vehicle type, identifying places with a high frequency of accidents, and determining the meteorological conditions most frequently related with accidents.
In order to assist time-based analysis, I also constructed a date calendar table and metrics like total CY casualties, total PY casualties, and total PY accidents, fatal, serious, and slight. 
Additionally, I developed a slicer to filter data according on the state of the weather and the road. I made a group depending on the kind of vehicle and the weather, and I computed measures for year-over-year (YOY) accidents and fatalities.
